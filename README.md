# Orthogonomic keyboard by MRS
This is a custom split keyboard, designed from scratch to learn how to design PCB's. 

I have always had a very big interest for circuits and thought this kind of project is a good way to learn how PCB design and manufactoring works. Since im still new at this there might be some small errors here and there. Daily i'm a Software Engineering student and thats the reason i chose to do a small project where i could challenge myself and learn som new stuff about electroengineering.

So if you would like a keyboard like this. Have at it. The license is MIT, so you can do whatever you want with it. manufacture for distribution, built for a friend and/or for yourself. :D

This keyboard is specifically made to be mirrored so you dont have to have 2 different PCB designs.

Here's some images of the PCB in an editor and a 3d viewer
